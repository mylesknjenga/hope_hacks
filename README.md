# Covered by Hope
### Hope Hacks

Covered by Hope is a website dedicated to educate people about the ongoing discrimination that the LGBTQIA+ community is subjected to by providing them with pertinent information and materials. The resource page is an api that pulls data from mongoDB and displays it for the user to see. The site also contains a weather check api that shows the weather in any city in the world. This is to help the user plan their protest better. There is also an admin page that enables the user to add, edit or delete resources from the site.
